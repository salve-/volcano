abstract = {We assess the potential of rotational ground motion recordings to reduce nonuniqueness in kinematic source inversions, with emphasis on the required measurement accuracy of currently developed rotation sensors. Our analysis is based on synthetic Bayesian finite source inversions that avoid linearizations and provide a comprehensive quantification of uncertainties and trade-offs. Using the fault and receiver geometry of the Tottori 2000 earthquake as a test bed, we perform inversions for two scenarios: In scenario I, we use translational velocity recordings only. In scenario II, we randomly replace half of the velocity recordings by rotation recordings, thus keeping the total amount of data constant. To quantify the noise-dependent impact of rotation recordings, we perform a sequence of inversions with varying noise levels of rotations relative to translations. Our results indicate that the incorporation of rotational ground motion recordings can significantly reduce nonuniqueness in finite source inversions, provided that measurement uncertainties are similar to or below the uncertainties of translational velocity recordings. When this condition is met, rupture velocity and rise time benefit most from rotation data. The trade-offs between both parameters are then strongly reduced, and the information gain nearly doubles. This suggests that rotational ground motion recordings may improve secondary inferences that rely on accurate information about rise time and rupture velocity. These include frictional properties of the fault, radiation directivity, and ground motion in general.},

abstract = {We use data from broadband seismometers deployed around the summit of Kilauea Volcano to quantify the mechanism associated with a transient in the flow of magma feeding the east rift eruption of the volcano. The transient is marked by rapid inflation of the Kilauea summit peaking at 22 μrad 4.5 hours after the event onset, followed by slow deflation over a period of 3 days. Superimposed on the summit inflation is a series of sawtooth displacement pulses, each characterized by a sudden drop in amplitude lasting 5–10 s followed by an exponential recovery lasting 1–3 min. The sawtooth waveforms display almost identical shapes, suggesting a process involving the repeated activation of a fixed source. The particle motion associated with each sawtooth is almost linear, and its major swing shows compressional motion at all stations. Analyses of semblance and particle motion are consistent with a point source located 1 km beneath the northeast edge of the Halemaumau pit crater. To estimate the source mechanism, we apply a moment tensor inversion to the waveform data, assuming a point source embedded in a homogeneous half-space with compressional and shear wave velocities representative of the average medium properties at shallow depth under Kilauea. Synthetic waveforms are constructed by a superposition of impulse responses for six moment tensor components and three single force components. The origin times of individual impulses are distributed along the time axis at appropriately small, equal intervals, and their amplitudes are determined by least squares. In this inversion, the source time functions of the six tensor and three force components are determined simultaneously. We confirm the accuracy of the inversion method through a series of numerical tests. The results from the inversion show that the waveform data are well explained by a pulsating transport mechanism operating on a subhorizontal crack linking the summit reservoir to the east rift of Kilauea. The crack acts like a buffer in which a batch of fluid (magma and/or gas) accumulates over a period of 1–3 min before being rapidly injected into a larger reservoir (possibly the east rift) over a timescale of 5–10 s. The seismic moment and volume change associated with a typical batch of fluid are approximately 1014 N m and 3000 m3, respectively. Our results also point to the existence of a single force component with amplitude of 109 N, which may be explained as the drag force generated by the flow of viscous magma through a narrow constriction in the flow path. The total volume of magma associated with the 4.5-hour-long activation of the pulsating source is roughly 500,000 m3 in good agreement with the integrated volume flow rate of magma estimated near the eruptive site.},

abstract = {The wave fields generated by Strombolian activity are investigated using data from small-aperture seismic arrays deployed on the north flank of Stromboli and data from seismic and pressure transducers set up near the summit crater. Measurements of slowness and azimuth as a function of time clearly indicate that the sources of tremor and explosions are located beneath the summit crater at depths shallower than 200 m with occasional bursts of energy originating from sources extending to a depth of 3 km. Slowness, azimuth, and particle motion measurements reveal a complex composition of body and surface waves associated with topography, structure, and source properties. Body waves originating at depths shallower than 200 m dominate the wave field at frequencies of 0.5–2.5 Hz, and surface waves generated by the surficial part of the source and by scattering sources distributed around the island dominate at frequencies above 2.5 Hz. The records of tremor and explosions are both dominated by SH motion. Far-field records from explosions start with radial motion, and near-field records from those events show dominantly horizontal motion and often start with a low-frequency (1–2 Hz) precursor characterized by elliptical particle motion, followed within a few seconds by a high-frequency radial phase (1–10 Hz) accompanying the eruption of pyroclastics. The dominant component of the near- and far-field particle motions from explosions, and the timing of air and body wave phases observed in the near field, are consistent with a gas-piston mechanism operating on a shallow (<200 m deep), vertical crack-like conduit. Models of a degassing fluid column suggest that noise emissions originating in the collective oscillations of bubbles ascending in the magma conduit may provide an adequate self-excitation mechanism for sustained tremor generation at Stromboli.},

To determine the source-centroid location and source mechanism, we minimize the residual error between data and synthetics calculated by the finite difference method for a point source embedded in a homogeneous elastic medium that takes topography into account. Two source centroids are identified, each representative of the distinct event types associated with explosive eruptions from two different vents. The observed waveforms are well reproduced by our inversion, and the two source centroids that best fit the data are offset 220 and 260 m beneath and ∼160 m northwest of the active vents. The source mechanisms include both moment-tensor and single-force components. The principal axes of the moment tensor have amplitude ratios 1:1:2, which can be interpreted as representative of a crack, if one assumes the rock matrix at the source to have a Poisson ratio ν = 1/3, a value appropriate for hot rock. Both imaged cracks dip ∼60° to the northwest and strike northeast–southwest along a direction parallel to the elongation of the volcanic edifice and a prominent zone of structural weakness, as expressed by lineaments, dikes, and brittle structures. For our data set, the volume changes estimated from the moments are ∼200 m3 for the largest explosion from each vent. Together with the volumetric source is a dominantly vertical force with a magnitude of 108 N, consistent with the inferred movement of the magma column perched above the source centroid in response to the piston-like rise of a slug of gas in the conduit.},

abstract = {The M 7.4 Landers earthquake triggered widespread seismicity in the western United States. Because the transient dynamic stresses induced at regional distances by the Landers surface waves are much larger than the expected static stresses, the magnitude and the characteristics of the dynamic stresses may bear upon the earthquake triggering mechanism. The Landers earthquake was recorded on the UPSAR (U.S. Geological Survey Parkfield Small Aperture Array) array, a group of 14 triaxial accelerometers located within a 1-square-km region 10 km southwest of the town of Parkfield, California, 412 km northwest of the Landers epicenter. No triggered earthquakes were observed at Parkfield. Multiple filter analysis shows that the displacements, obtained by double integration, are dominated by the fundamental mode Love and Rayleigh modes, with some higher-mode contributions for periods shorter than 10 s. Most of the surface waves propagated along the great circle path from Landers, but a late arriving surface wave appears to have been scattered from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We used a standard geodetic inversion procedure to determine the surface strain and stress tensors as functions of time from the observed displacements. Peak dynamic strains and stresses at Earth's surface are about 7 μstrain and 0.035 MPa, respectively, and they have a flat amplitude spectrum between 2-s and 15-s period. These stresses agree well with stresses predicted from a simple equation using the ground velocity spectrum observed at a single station. Peak stresses ranged from about 0.035 MPa at the surface to about 0.12 MPa between 2 and 14 km depth, with the sharp increase of stress away from the surface resulting from the rapid increase of rigidity with depth and from the influence of mode shapes. Because of the free-surface boundary conditions, the horizontal components of the stress tensor tend to dominate in the top 5–6 km of the crust, which might cause triggered seismicity to have strike-slip or normal mechanisms. Comparison of dynamic stresses induced by the Landers, Loma Prieta, and Petrolia earthquakes at a variety of sites indicates that the Landers stresses were not spectacularly larger than those induced by the other sources. Landers dynamic stresses were comparable to Coalinga static stresses at Parkfield. The effective strain caused by Landers at Parkfield, where no earthquakes were triggered, are the same amplitude as those at some sites in Nevada where earthquakes were triggered. Comparing various authors' observations of dynamic stresses, there is no obvious characteristic of these stresses that correlates with the triggered seismicity.},

abstract ={The 28 September 2004 Parkfield, California, earthquake (Mw 6.0) and four aftershocks (Mw 4.7–5.1) were recorded on 12 accelerograph stations of the U.S. Geological Survey Parkfield seismic array (UPSAR), an array of three-component accelerographs occupying an area of about 1 km2 located 8.8 km from the San Andreas fault. Peak horizontal acceleration and velocity at UPSAR during the mainshock were 0.45g and 27 cm/sec, respectively. We determined both time-varying and peak values of ground dilatations, shear strains, torsions, tilts, torsion rates, and tilt rates by applying a time-dependent geodetic analysis to the observed array displacement time series. Array-derived dilatations agree fairly well with point measurements made on high sample rate recordings of the Parkfield-area dilatometers (Johnston et al., 2006). Torsion Fourier amplitude spectra agree well with ground velocity spectra, as expected for propagating plane waves. A simple predictive relation, using the predicted peak velocity from the Boore–Atkinson ground-motion prediction relation (Boore and Atkinson, 2007) scaled by a phase velocity of 1 km/sec, predicts observed peak Parkfield and Chi-Chi rotations (Huang, 2003) well. However, rotation rates measured during Mw 5 Ito, Japan, events observed on a gyro sensor (Takeo, 1998) are factors of 5–60 greater than those predicted by our predictive relation. This discrepancy might be caused by a scale dependence in rotation, with rotations measured over a short baseline exceeding those measured over long baselines. An alternative hypothesis is that events having significant non-double-couple mechanisms, like the Ito events, radiate much stronger rotations than double-couple events. If this is true, then rotational observations might provide an important source of new information for monitoring seismicity in volcanic areas.},

abstract = {Cavities, surface topography, and inhomogeneities in elastic constants all distort the strains and tilts produced by stresses in the earth. Hence locally observed strains and tilts deviate from those calculated on the basis of simple earth models. We investigate these deviations on the assumption that the scale of these inhomogeneities is small in comparison with that of the stress fields. The results are applicable to observations of free modes, earth tides, and regional tectonic stresses. Analytical results are given for the deformation of an ellipsoidal cavity in a homogeneous medium in which the strain is uniform at large distances from the cavity. One important result is that greatly magnified strains are expected across narrow cavities. Finite element techniques are employed to study two features of importance in actual cavities, the influence of the corner in a tunnel of square cross section and the influence of the end face in a cylindrical tunnel with plane ends. The floor of the perfectly regular square tunnel remains flat, but irregularities produce large local tilts. Longitudinal strain in the cylindrical cavity is magnified near its ends, and most of the anomalous strain is concentrated within one tunnel diameter of the end. Topographic effects are also studied by finite element techniques. These are found to be very large and to result in strain magnifications in valleys, strain diminutions in hills, and strain-induced tilts which are different for vertical and horizontal surfaces. In one case, regional compression actually results in local tension, and even a 1 in 10 (5.7°) slope produces a 36% perturbation in strain. Geological effects are investigated for a profile near Boulder, Colorado, where there is a very abrupt transition between the sedimentary rocks of the plains and the basement rocks of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The surface strains perpendicular to the boundary fall from 177% to 37% of their regional values on crossing this boundary, and strain-induced tilts attain values of about 0.5 times the regional strain in its vicinity. Long-base strain meters and tiltmeters can give good results in underground sites, but short-base instruments are very susceptible to local effects arising from geometric irregularities or rock inhomogeneities. Corrections for local topography are required for most installations. This topographic effect can be exploited to measure regional strains with tiltmeters, while the geological effects provide the basis of a technique for using earth tide observations to explore geological structure.},

We analysed these events, as well as very long period (VLP) events which were associated with some of them. During some intervals the spectral and wavefield features of \{LP\} events remained steady, with significant changes occurring between the intervals. Based on the times of the changes, we distinguish five different sub-periods. In particular, during sub-period \{III\} (June–November 2005) the wavefield at the stations nearest to the summit area was composed of P waves. Locations for 150 \{LP\} events occurring in sub-period III, determined using radial semblance, changed, at the same time as the events' spectral features changed. It was during this sub-period that many of the \{LP\} events were associated with \{VLP\} events. Based on similarity of the waveforms, we distinguished two families of \{VLP\} events, with gradually evolving waveforms. The two families are located in slightly different places, but near the sources of the \{LP\} events. The change between the families occurred at the same time as the spectra of the \{LP\} events changed. Finally the source of the \{VLP\} events was investigated by performing complete waveform moment tensor inversion of stacks of the two families. Synthetic Green's functions for the full moment tensor were calculated for a homogeneous half-space. For both families, the source region with the highest variance reduction lies approximately beneath the active craters, at 500&#xa0;m below the altitudes of the stations. The solutions for both families are very similar with sources that are between 60 and 70% isotropic. Attempts to determine deviatoric moment tensors produced consistently poorer fits. The remaining energy is poorly constrained and is likely to be noise. In conclusion, these results highlight changes in the \{LP\} and \{VLP\} events at Mt. Etna over time, and the causal relationship between them. "

During this period lava was flowing from a lateral fracture after a summit Strombolian eruption. In order to understand the mechanisms of these events, we perform moment tensor inversions. Inversions are initially kept unconstrained to estimate the most likely mechanism. Numerical tests show that unconstrained inversion leads to reliable moment tensor solutions because of the close proximity of numerous stations to the source positions. However, single forces cannot be accurately determined as they are very sensitive to uncertainties in the velocity model. Constrained inversions for a crack, a pipe or an explosion then allow us to accurately determine the structural orientations of the source mechanisms. Both numerical tests and LP event inversions emphasise the importance of using stations located as close as possible to the source. Inversions for both families show mechanisms with a strong volumetric component. These events are most likely generated by cracks striking SW–NE for both families and dipping 70° SE (family 1) and 50° NW (family 2). For family 1 events, the crack geometry is nearly orthogonal to the dikelike structure along which events are located, while for family 2 the location gave two pipelike bodies that belong to the same plane as the crack mechanism. The orientations of the cracks are consistent with local tectonics, which shows a SW–NE weakness direction. The LP events appear to be a response to the lava fountain occurring on 10 May 2008 as opposed to the flank lava flow.},

  abstract ={The main goal of this study is to improve the modelling of the source mechanism associated with the generation of long period (LP) signals in volcanic areas. Our intent is to evaluate the effects that detailed structural features of the volcanic models play in the generation of LP signal and the consequent retrieval of LP source characteristics. In particular, effects associated with the presence of topography and crustal heterogeneities are here studied in detail. We focus our study on a LP event observed at Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, in 2001 May. A detailed analysis of this event and its source modelling is accompanied by a set of synthetic tests, which aim to evaluate the effects of topography and the presence of low velocity shallow layers in the source region. The forward problem of Green's function generation is solved numerically following a pseudo-spectral approach, assuming different 3-D models. The inversion is done in the frequency domain and the resulting source mechanism is represented by the sum of two time-dependent terms: a full moment tensor and a single force. Synthetic tests show how characteristic velocity structures, associated with shallow sources, may be partially responsible for the generation of the observed long-lasting ringing waveforms. When applying the inversion technique to Kilauea LP data set, inversions carried out for different crustal models led to very similar source geometries, indicating a subhorizontal cracks. On the other hand, the source time function and its duration are significantly different for different models. These results support the indication of a strong influence of crustal layering on the generation of the LP signal, while the assumption of homogeneous velocity model may bring to misleading results.},

abstract ={The spac (Spatial autocorrelation) method to analyze ambient vibration records was introduced by Aki (1957). Currently, this method is being used for the analysis of microtremor data from an array of stations: crosscorrelation functions are computed between pairs of stations, and then averaged for different station pairs, at the same interstation distance but with different orientation. In this article we propose the idea of exploiting recordings of microtremors over long times as a substitute for spatial averaging, as was suggested in Aki (1957). This idea has several advantages. The two most important are, first, that it is not required to obtain simultaneous recordings using an array of stations, whose locations must obey a very rigid scheme; and second, the ability to obtain results for a large number of closely-spaced distance intervals. Our proposal is tested using data from the Parkway, Wainuiomata, temporary array. These data are supplemented with additional measurements performed during February 2003, to resolve an uncertainty regarding the low-frequency part of our results. Given the irregular distribution of our array, we are able to obtain results for many different station pairs. The phase-velocity dispersion curves we derive from our measurements, interpreted with the spac method, are compared with previous results in this sedimentary basin. Our results suggest that the spac method is more general than appears in recently published papers.},

abstract ={A new waveform inversion method is proposed to deal with horizontal seismograms strongly contaminated by tilt signals, without assumptions regarding tilt motions. Instead of decomposing the horizontal seismograms into translational and tilt contributions, we realize this task by calculating the Green's functions consisting of not only the seismometer's response to the synthetic translational motions but also to the synthetic tilt motions. A finite difference method (FDM), which uses a staggered grid and a perfect matched layer (PML) boundary condition, is used to calculate the Green's functions. This method enables calculation of wavefields which have wavelengths of up to 10 times larger than the dimension of the computational grid. Although reflected waves from the numerical boundaries are negligible, comparisons with analytical solutions evidence errors of up to several per cent. These occur either because the source-to-receiver distance is small once compared to the grid size, or as a consequence of the half-cell difference between the actual free surface and the station location. In addition, in the case that the free surface is not flat, an error of up to 60 per cent occurs in calculating the tilt motion, due to the stair-like approximation of topography in the FDM. This latter error can be reduced to 10 per cent by averaging the tilts at five adjacent cells aligned in the direction of the tilt component, centred on the target grid cell. By applying this algorithm, a waveform inversion can be used to successfully reconstruct the vertical and horizontal seismograms of very-long-period (10–30 s) pulses at Asama Volcano, central Japan, despite the fact that the horizontal seismograms are strongly contaminated by tilt signals.},

abstract = {The current (March 2008 to February 2009) summit eruptive activity at Kilauea Volcano is characterized by explosive degassing bursts accompanied by very long period (VLP) seismic signals. We model the source mechanisms of VLP signals in the 10–50 s band using data recorded for 15 bursts with a 10-station broadband network deployed in the summit caldera. To determine the source centroid location and source mechanism, we minimize the residual error between data and synthetics calculated by the finite difference method for a point source embedded in a homogeneous medium that takes topography into account. The VLP signals associated with the bursts originate in a source region ∼1 km below the eastern perimeter of Halemaumau pit crater. The observed waveforms are well explained by the combination of a volumetric component and a vertical single force component. For the volumetric component, several source geometries are obtained which equally explain the observed waveforms. These geometries include (1) a pipe dipping 64° to the northeast; (2) two intersecting cracks including an east striking crack (dike) dipping 80° to the north, intersecting a north striking crack (another dike) dipping 65° to the east; (3) a pipe dipping 58° to the northeast, intersecting a crack dipping 48° to the west–southwest; and (4) a pipe dipping 57° to the northeast, intersecting a pipe dipping 58° to the west–southwest. Using the dual-crack model as reference, the largest volume change obtained among the 15 bursts is ∼24,400 m3, and the maximum amplitude (peak to peak) of the force is ∼20 GN. Each burst is marked by a similar sequence of deflation and inflation, trailed by decaying oscillations of the volumetric source. The vertical force is initially upward, synchronous with source deflation, then downward, synchronous with source reinflation, followed by oscillations with polarity opposite to the volumetric oscillations. This combination of force and volume change is attributed to pressure and momentum changes induced during a fluid dynamic source mechanism involving the ascent, expansion, and burst of a large slug of gas within the upper ∼150 m of the magma conduit. As the slug expands upon approach to the surface and more liquid becomes wall supported by viscous shear forces, the pressure below the slug decreases, inducing conduit deflation and an upward force on the Earth. The final rapid slug expansion and burst stimulate VLP and LP oscillations of the conduit system, which slowly decay due to viscous dissipation and elastic radiation. Consideration of the fluid dynamic arguments leads us to prefer the dual-crack VLP source model as it is the only candidate model capable of producing plausible values of length scales and pressure changes. The magnitudes of the vertical forces observed in the 15 bursts appear consistent with slug masses of 104 to 106 kg.},
